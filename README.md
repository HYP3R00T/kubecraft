## Dev Container

We've set up a simple dev container for the project.

By installing neovim through the neovim-homebrew feature, brew is also available.

### Recommended packages

- Terraform is not available as an official dev container feature
- installing Azure CLI through brew allows automatic zsh completion to be installed

```bash
# Terraform
brew tap hashicorp/tap
brew install hashicorp/tap/terraform

# Azure CLI
brew install azure-cli
```
